<!--Style:-->
<!--While getting the right answer is important, we are also interested in how well thought out your-->
<!--solution is; are there easier, or faster ways? Is the code understandable to another engineer picking-->
<!--it up? If there are obvious ways it could be abstracted or extended, is it designed to support-->
<!--that? For example, this N-tuple detection algorithm may end up being used in other contexts (like a-->
<!--website) and so should be easy to reuse.-->
<!--Questions?-->
<!--Some aspects of the problem are intentionally vague. We recommend that you make your own-->
<!--decisions rather than ask us and wait for an answer. Document any important assumptions that you-->
<!--make in your solution.-->
